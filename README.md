<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>I built this project throughout my coursework in Programming Language Fundamentals at Oregon State University in the Spring of 2024. It is coded in Ruby, and is intended to demonstrate the characteristics of an object-oriented programming language.</p>
<p>This in an implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard which was originally developed by Sam Kass. The primary code is in the lab3.rb file, though it relies on class definitions in element.rb, player.rb, and history.rb.</p>
